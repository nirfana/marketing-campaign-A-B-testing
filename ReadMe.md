## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the effectiveness of different marketing strategies through A/B testing analysis using a simulated dataset from a fast-food chain. The company plans to introduce a new menu item and is testing three different promotional campaigns across various market locations and sizes to determine which strategy drives the highest sales.

### 🧪 Objective

The main goal of this analysis is to evaluate the impact of each promotion on weekly sales and identify the most effective campaign. This will involve:

- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and trends in the data.
- Comparing sales performance across the three promotional strategies.
- Conducting statistical tests to determine if differences in sales are statistically significant.
- Providing actionable insights based on the results.

### 🗃️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains sales data from multiple store locations over a four-week period, including:

- `MarketID`: Unique identifier for each market
- `MarketSize`: Market area size (by sales volume)
- `LocationID`: Unique identifier for each store location
- `AgeOfStore`: Store age in years
- `Promotion`: Type of promotional campaign used (one of three types)
- `week`: Week number (1 to 4)
- `SalesInThousands`: Sales of the new menu item (in thousands of dollars)
